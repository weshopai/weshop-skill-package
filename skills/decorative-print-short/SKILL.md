name: decorative-print-short
description: Use for a decorative print-illustration short with fine closed linework, flat restrained color, dense ornament, a wide-establishing then close-follow shot rhythm, and sparse synchronized material SFX. Unlike generate-video (relationship 0.66), choose this when the print grammar and paired-shot structure own the result; choose generate-video for a general clip. Do not use for protected designs, logos, dialogue, or automatic music.

## Workflow
1. Lock generic line, flat-color, ornament, and material rules; exclude protected patterns and logos.
2. Approve scene key art and two-shot order before video.
3. Generate approved shots through `$generate-video`, persist per-shot keys, then use `$combine-videos` only for requested assembly.
4. Check print consistency, one action per close shot, hard-cut order, and no unrequested audio/text.
