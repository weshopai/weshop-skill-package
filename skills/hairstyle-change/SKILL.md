## What this skill does

- Produces one portrait with one requested hairstyle.
- Accepts text or a hairstyle reference whose identity is not transferred.
- Reconstructs newly exposed ears, neck, shoulders, and background naturally.

## How to use

Provide one clear portrait and describe one hairstyle; optionally supply one hair-only reference.

#### Preview a bob

```text
Give this person a chin-length softly waved bob with a side part, keeping their natural hair color.
```

## Workflow

1. Bind the source portrait as identity and an optional second image as hairstyle geometry only.
2. Record length, texture, part, volume, finish, and hair-color lock.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Request one hairstyle and forbid face transfer, color drift, makeup or wardrobe changes, text, and panels.
5. Inspect face landmarks, hairline, strand boundaries, ears, neck, background repair, and scene continuity. Retry only the failed geometry or lock.
