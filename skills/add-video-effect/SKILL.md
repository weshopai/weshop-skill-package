## What this skill does

- Adds a bounded effect such as glow, particles, flare, weather or speed treatment.
- Anchors timing, target, duration and interaction so the effect does not become a full restyle.

## How to use

Provide video, exact effect, target, start and end time, intensity and protected content.

#### Example

```text
Add a subtle golden particle trail behind the skateboard from 00:02–00:04; preserve rider, board and camera.
```

## Workflow

1. Locate effect interval, tracked target, occlusions and protected regions.
2. Specify onset, evolution, interaction, intensity and exit as one bounded effect.
3. Run MiniMax H3, the cataloged source-video editing model, with bounded temporal and regional instructions.
4. Inspect frames before, during and after for tracking, spill, timing and preservation.
