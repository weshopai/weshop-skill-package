name: brand-promo-video-generator
description: Create one complete short promotional video for a brand, app, website, shop, service, launch, or mixed brand system from verified identity assets, a brand-truth and provenance manifest, campaign direction, timed beats, generated media, assembly, and final authenticity QC. Use when the campaign subject is broader than one product-benefit claim. Unlike make-product-commercial (relationship 0.86), choose this for brand-system, digital-product, service, shop, or launch storytelling; choose make-product-commercial when one supplied product and its truthful causal benefit own a 5–30 second ad. Unlike make-explainer-video (0.58), this optimizes promotion and CTA rather than source-backed education. It may call generate-video (0.49) for shots and combine-videos (0.36) for assembly. Do not use for one generic shot, editing-only supplied footage, invented claims, or approximate identity assets.

# Brand Promo Video Generator

## Catalog

- Display name: Brand Promo Video Generator
- Category: Video and audio
- Status: Ready
- Route label: Verified-brand multi-beat campaign video
- Tone: purple
- Short description: Produce one authenticity-checked promotional short for a brand, app, website, shop, service, or launch.

## What this skill does

- Builds a source-backed brand truth sheet and identity-asset provenance manifest before creative production.
- Converts one campaign goal into a timed multi-beat promotional story with verified proof, readable copy, authentic assets, and a clear CTA.
- Generates and assembles only the needed media, then checks claims, identity, pacing, language, audio, and final campaign integrity.

## How to use

Provide the campaign subject and goal, target audience/channel, duration, ratio, official URL when relevant, authorized logo/UI/product/people/packaging assets, brand colors/type guidance, verified features or claims, required copy/CTA/disclaimers, language, audio preference, and forbidden content.

#### Example

```text
Make a 20-second 9:16 launch promo for this habit-tracking app. Use the supplied logo and UI exports exactly, target first-time runners, show the real plan/reminder/progress flow, use English on-screen copy, and finish with the approved “Start your first week” CTA.
```

## Workflow

1. Lock campaign subject, audience, channel, duration, ratio, language, focus, CTA, audio, required claims, prohibited inventions, and delivery files. If one supplied product and its truthful causal benefit dominate the story, route to `make-product-commercial`; if teaching a sourced topic dominates, route to `make-explainer-video`.
2. Build a brand truth sheet from user-provided originals and official/company-controlled sources. Record exact names, features, claims, metrics, slogans, disclaimers, colors, typography behavior, tone, motifs, UI states, and approved CTA. Separate verified fact, user-approved campaign copy, inference, and placeholder.
3. Create a compact provenance manifest for every identity-bearing asset: stable ID, role, user path or exact source, source type, verification target, authenticity status, and publication caveat. Never redraw or approximate logos, wordmarks, product UI, packaging, mascots, named people, or other identity evidence. Ask for an authorized original when a required identity asset is unavailable.
4. Choose one campaign spine appropriate to the subject: intent-to-result for apps/SaaS, context-to-proof for services, collection-to-experience for shops, identity-to-benefit for brands, or reveal-to-action for launches. Define hook, mechanism or experience, verified proof, payoff, brand lockup, and CTA. Obtain approval before paid generation unless the user already approved the exact treatment.
5. Build a timecoded beat and shot manifest totaling the requested duration. Every beat gets one visual owner, authentic asset IDs, primary action, proof or message, exact copy and readable hold, color state, transition, sound/voice beat, generation or deterministic method, and acceptance. Exact logo, UI, long copy, CTA, and disclaimers remain supplied plates or deterministic overlays.
6. Generate only missing non-identity visuals and atomic shots. Select one current model per shot: Kling 3.0 for precise product/UI/frame/reference control, Seedance 2.5 for audio-visual or artistic synchronization, Seedance 2.0 for routine motion, and MiniMax H3 for justified large-amplitude action. Use one durable `operationKey`, require `executionId`, poll to terminal state, and never trial models in sequence.
7. Inspect each result for authentic identity assets, product/UI geometry, intended action, claim truth, cast identity, camera, duration, ratio, language, forbidden additions, and usable audio. Reject fake UI, rebuilt logos, invented metrics, or generated copy presented as verified evidence. Repair only the failing asset or shot with a new linked key and specific revision.
8. Hand accepted assets to `combine-videos` or another deterministic editor in manifest order. Add supplied logo plates, exact copy, CTA, disclaimers, captions, narration, and supported/user-supplied music through deterministic finishing. Do not duplicate native and separate soundtracks or imply unsupported standalone speech/music generation.
9. Watch the complete export and inspect representative frames and copy holds. Confirm hook, campaign-specific proof, brand truth, asset provenance, copy/CTA accuracy and readability, logo/UI integrity, pacing, transitions, language, sound, duration/ratio, safe zones, no blank/corrupt frames, and no unintended watermark. Report caveats and leave publication to the user.
