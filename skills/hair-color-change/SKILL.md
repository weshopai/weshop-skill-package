## What this skill does

- Produces one recolored-hair portrait from one authorized source portrait.
- Changes pigment only; keeps length, texture, volume, part, hairline, and flyaways.
- Preserves identity and every non-hair region.

## How to use

Provide one clear portrait and name one target shade or coloring pattern.

#### Preview auburn hair

```text
Change this person’s hair to natural copper auburn with subtle root depth.
```

## Workflow

1. Confirm the portrait is authorized and contains one clearly visible person.
2. Record target color, distribution, intensity, and whether eyebrows must remain unchanged.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Recolor the existing hair while preserving hairstyle geometry, hairline, face, skin, eyes, clothing, pose, crop, lighting, and background. Forbid haircut changes, wigs, extra subjects, text, or panels.
5. Poll to terminal state and compare hair silhouette, facial landmarks, skin tone, and scene. Retry only the failed property with revised wording.
