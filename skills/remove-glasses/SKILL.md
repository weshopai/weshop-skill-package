## How to use
Provide one authorized portrait with visible glasses and state any eye traits that must remain.
#### Remove eyeglasses
```text
Remove the eyeglasses, lens glare, and frame shadows; preserve gaze, eye color, expression, and identity.
```
## Workflow
1. Inspect frame path, lens distortion, glare, shadow, occluded brows, nose bridge, temples, and hair.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. Request face-aware reconstruction; forbid eye enlargement, makeup, skin smoothing, face reshaping, or expression changes.
4. Compare eye spacing, gaze, iris color, eyelids, brows, bridge, temples, ears, hair, and facial symmetry.
5. Reject frame remnants, phantom glare, mismatched eyes, invented eyelashes, skin seams, or identity drift.
