```text
Turn only the cyclist into solid black on the sunset; retain bicycle spoke gaps.
```
## Workflow
1. Define target contour, important negative spaces, ground contact, and background.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. Fill target uniformly; do not darken the whole image.
4. Inspect edge continuity, accessories, negative spaces, halos, holes, and recognizable pose.
5. Hand off to `$remove-background` when transparent alpha is requested.
