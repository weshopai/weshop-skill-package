## What this skill does
- Identifies one target region and changes hue/chroma without flattening material.
- Keeps untargeted objects, people, background, lighting, and geometry unchanged.
## How to use
Provide image, target object, and color name, swatch, RGB, or hex.
#### Recolor one product
```text
Change only the yellow chair to #174A36; preserve grain, highlights, and shadow.
```
## Workflow
1. Bind target by object, location, and optional mask; define trim, logo, hardware, and reflection scope.
2. Preserve the original luminance structure and material response.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Forbid global grade, material replacement, geometry drift, or background edits.
5. Compare coverage, edge halos, texture, highlights, shadows, and neutral regions.
