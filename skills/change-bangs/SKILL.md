## What this skill does

- Produces one portrait with one requested bangs style.
- Limits editing to the forehead and front hair section.
- Preserves the remaining cut, hair color, identity, face, and scene.

## How to use

Provide one front or three-quarter portrait and describe the fringe shape and length.

#### Add curtain bangs

```text
Add soft eyebrow-length curtain bangs with a light center opening.
```

## Workflow

1. Confirm forehead, hairline, eyebrows, and both eyes are sufficiently visible.
2. Record fringe type, opening, length, density, texture, and color lock.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Restrict the edit to front hair; preserve all other hair, eyes, facial proportions, skin, clothing, crop, lighting, and background.
5. Check hairline integration, eye visibility, requested shape, and identity. Retry only the failed local property.
