name: lip-product-commercial
description: Use for a lip-color commercial with model, packaging, shade, finish, application, texture, and natural product-interaction proof held consistent across planned shots. Unlike generate-video (relationship 0.63), choose this when lip-specific evidence and anchor gates own the deliverable; choose generate-video for a general product shot. Unlike product-detail-page (0.67), choose this for moving commercial media rather than a static commerce page. Do not use for skincare or eye-makeup campaigns.

# Lip Product Commercial

## Catalog

- Display name: Lip Product Commercial
- Category: Video
- Status: Ready
- Route label: Lip-color proof commercial production
- Tone: pink
- Short description: Plan and produce an anchor-locked lip-product commercial with application, texture, shade, and packshot evidence.

## What this skill does

- Locks a model/face reference, product reference, and approved storyboard before moving media.
- Plans beauty, texture, application, model-product, and closing-packshot proof without obscuring lips or labels.
- Preserves product silhouette, shade, cap, label placement, and visible finish across accepted shots.

## How to use

Provide product/model references or a brief, target ratio/duration, copy rules, and licensed music if required. A Canvas-capable Agent may retain approved anchors and storyboard there; otherwise it uses chat or local delivery.

#### Example

```text
用这支唇釉做 20 秒 16:9 广告：保留瓶身、豆沙色和玻璃唇光泽；需要模特上唇、质地特写、自然拿取和收尾 packshot，不要背景音乐。
```

## Workflow

1. Lock product and model evidence; use the current verified image route to create missing approved anchors only when needed.
2. Create a storyboard with one proof claim per shot. Keep text in safe negative space and never over lips, face, applicator, or label.
3. Wait for approval, then route each atomic shot through `$generate-video`; use the product/model anchors as named references and preserve only source-supported brand facts.
4. Persist an `operationKey` per asset, poll receipts, and assemble accepted clips through `$combine-videos` only on request. Do not fabricate music or readable package copy.

## User-facing output

- Media type: Approved storyboard and requested MP4 shots or assembly
- Default quantity: One commercial cut
- Content per video: Lip beauty, texture/application proof, and packshot
- Default layout: User-requested ratio
- Model policy: Verified image route for anchors and catalog-selected video route for shots
- Downstream use: Lipstick, tint, gloss, oil, and glaze campaigns

## Route

- Upstream assets: Product and optional model references
- Downstream handoff: `$combine-videos` for accepted shot assembly
