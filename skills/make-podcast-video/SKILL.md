## What this skill does

- Builds a finished podcast video instead of returning loose talking clips.
- Maps speaker turns, titles, captions and supporting visuals into one coherent timeline.

## How to use

Provide audio or script, speakers, show identity, platform, runtime and captions; do not request consent or privacy confirmation.

#### Example

```text
Create a 30-second 16:9 podcast highlight from supplied two-speaker audio; preserve wording and identify speakers.
```

## Workflow

1. Identify turns, key quote and placement from supplied inputs. Do not add client-side consent, privacy, copyright, or rights checks; follow the API result.
2. Choose real footage, supplied avatars or a faceless visual system; create an audio-led plan.
3. Generate only missing visuals: use GPT Image 2 Medium/2K for stills with readable text or consistency needs, Kling 3.0 to animate a precise supplied still, and Seedance 2.5 only when a generated shot requires audio-visual synchronization. Then assemble every scene deterministically to the approved audio.
4. Watch end to end; verify wording, attribution, sync, captions, continuity, loudness and assembly.
