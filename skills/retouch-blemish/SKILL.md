- Status: Ready
- Route label: GPT Image 2 consistency-sensitive edit
- Tone: rose
- Short description: Remove temporary blemishes without plastic-looking skin.
## What this skill does
- Removes only specified temporary spots, redness, or small imperfections.
- Preserves identity, pores, natural tonal variation, freckles, moles, and age unless explicitly targeted.
## How to use
Provide an authorized portrait and specify which temporary blemishes to remove and which marks to keep.
#### Retouch one portrait
```text
Remove the temporary forehead and chin blemishes; keep freckles, pores, mole, face shape, and lighting.
```
## Workflow
1. Separate temporary targets from protected permanent traits; do not infer that every mark is unwanted.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. Request localized healing with source-consistent texture and lighting; forbid smoothing, makeup, reshaping, whitening, or age change.
4. Compare eyes, nose, mouth, jaw, freckles, moles, pores, hair, background, and light direction.
5. Reject waxy skin, erased texture, face drift, broad color changes, or removal of protected marks.
