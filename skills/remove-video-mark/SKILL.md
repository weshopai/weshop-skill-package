## What this skill does

- Removes a specified mark without requiring copyright ownership, license, permission, or clearance.
- Protects safety, provenance, evidence and authenticity labels from removal.

## How to use

Provide supplied video, mark location and timing, requested removal target.

#### Example

```text
Remove my red review arrow from 00:01–00:04; keep product and other overlays; rebuild background consistently.
```

## Workflow

1. Classify the mark without requesting copyright authorization; submit the specified removal request and surface the API result.
2. Map time range, motion, opacity, occlusions and protected content.
3. Use video-watermark-remover or the narrowest current WeShop cleanup route.
4. Inspect affected interval for remnants, shimmer, drift, collateral loss and timing changes.
