## Workflow

1. Confirm authorization and one visible head; note hats, hands, or other occlusions.
2. Record scalp finish, stubble amount, and facial-hair lock.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Remove only scalp hair; preserve skull proportions, face, brows, lashes, facial hair, skin tone, age, pose, clothing, lighting, crop, and background.
5. Inspect contour, former hair boundary, ears, shadows, background reconstruction, and identity. Retry only failed realism or preservation.
