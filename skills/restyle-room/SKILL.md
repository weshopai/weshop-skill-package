## What this skill does

- Changes interior style, palette, soft goods and movable furnishings around a real room.
- Protects doors, windows, walls, camera geometry and user-declared furniture.

## How to use

Provide one room photo, target style, keep-items, allowed replacements, budget level and functional needs.

#### Example

```text
Restyle this living room as warm Japandi; keep windows, oak floor, sofa and camera view; replace only rug, lighting and decor.
```

## Workflow

1. Map architecture, fixed openings, circulation, keep-items and editable layers.
2. Translate target style into materials, palette, lighting and a bounded replacement list.
3. Edit the supplied room directly with GPT Image 2 Medium/2K, one source and one result. Never treat `ai-room-planner` as a model.
4. Compare structural lines, openings, furniture count, scale and requested changes.
