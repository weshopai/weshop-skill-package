## What this skill does
- Produces a factual content brief before image generation.
- Organizes one message, five to seven evidence points, labels, units, and a source line.
## How to use
Provide topic, audience, locale, channel, ratio, and mandatory sources or claims.
#### Make a sourced infographic
```text
Research household water-saving actions and make a Chinese vertical infographic with sources.
```
## Workflow
1. Research primary or authoritative sources; record URLs, dates, units, geography, and caveats.
2. Freeze exact title, subtitle, five to seven points, labels, and source line.
3. Choose comparison, process, timeline, map, hierarchy, or dashboard structure from the data relationship.
4. Use `gpt-image` v1.0 at Medium with the frozen brief and ask it to render the complete infographic; retry only the incorrect text or hierarchy with a stricter prompt.
5. Compare every number and word to the brief; reject invented facts, bad units, illegible type, or misleading charts.
When this Skill selects GPT Image 2, use `quality: "medium"` and `imageSize: "2K"` by default; change either only when the user explicitly requests another tier.

Every GPT Image 2 call in this Skill defaults to Medium at 2K; use another tier only when the user explicitly requests it.
