## What this skill does

- Preserves species, facial structure, coat pattern, eye color and signature markings from pet references.
- Applies one declared portrait treatment without inventing accessories or changing breed traits.

## How to use

Provide pet photos, the pet name, desired portrait style, crop and background.

#### Example

```text
Create a dignified oil-painting portrait of this dog on deep green; preserve the white left-ear patch and amber eyes.
```

## Workflow

1. Identify pet-specific invariants across references and resolve conflicting views.
2. Choose one crop, expression, background and style; keep identity anchors explicit.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Compare ears, muzzle, markings, eyes and proportions against the source.
