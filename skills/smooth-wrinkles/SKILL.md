## What this skill does
- Treats skin lines and fabric creases as different AI edits with different protected traits.
- Reduces distracting wrinkles while retaining realistic texture and form-defining folds.
## How to use
Provide image, target region, skin or garment type, and desired reduction strength.
#### Smooth garment wrinkles
```text
Reduce packing creases on the linen shirt body; keep seams, weave, collar structure, and natural elbow folds.
```
## Workflow
1. Classify target as skin or garment and identify structural lines that must remain.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. For skin, preserve age and identity; for fabric, preserve weave, seams, drape, edges, and volume.
4. Forbid anatomy, silhouette, garment design, color, background, makeup, or relighting changes.
5. Reject plastic skin, iron-flat fabric, melted seams, lost texture, or unrelated edits.
