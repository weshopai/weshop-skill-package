## Workflow
1. Inventory removable clutter and protected structure, furniture, decor, textiles, windows, doors, and fixtures.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. Request one spatially coherent cleanup; forbid redesign, new furniture, staging, material changes, or relighting.
4. Inspect perspective lines, floor/wall continuation, reflections, shadows, repeated textures, furniture count, and room proportions.
5. Reject missing protected items, added decor, warped architecture, floating furniture, or over-empty staged results.
