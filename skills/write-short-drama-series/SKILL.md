description: Develop a premise, novel, synopsis, or source story into a production-ready vertical short-drama series bible, episode outline, continuity ledger, and requested episode scripts.

# Write Short Drama Series

## Catalog

- Display name: Write Short Drama Series
- Category: Narrative and comics
- Status: Ready
- Route label: Agent-authored serialized drama package
- Tone: blue
- Short description: Turn a story into a validated short-drama bible, episode arc, continuity ledger, and scripts.

## What this skill does

- Separates fixed source facts from adaptations and records every deliberate change.
- Designs an exact-count episode arc with escalating conflict, episode-level hooks, delayed payoffs, and a resolved ending.
- Writes shootable scripts against a locked series bible and updates continuity after each accepted episode.

## How to use

Provide the premise or source, target market and audience, language, genre, episode count, approximate episode duration, content rating, fixed characters/facts, ending preference, and whether you need the complete package or selected episodes.

#### Example

```text
Adapt this workplace revenge synopsis into a 20-episode vertical short drama in Chinese, about 90 seconds per episode. Preserve the sister relationship, place the major identity reveal around episode 12, and deliver the bible, outline, and scripts for episodes 1–3.
```

## Workflow

1. Create a source-fact ledger with `fixed`, `inferred`, `open`, and `proposed change` entries. Ask before changing a fixed protagonist, relationship, central motive, ending, episode count, rating, or market constraint.
2. Lock a compact series bible: logline, audience promise, genre/tone, world rules, character goals/secrets/relationships, core conflict, escalation engine, reveal schedule, ending, and prohibited changes.
3. Build the exact-count episode table before scripting. Each row records opening image, immediate objective, conflict, visible turn, new information, payoff/debt, end hook, and continuity changes. Seed major payoffs early enough to feel earned.
4. Validate the season arc: a concrete hook in episode 1; no repeated conflict with only renamed dialogue; rising cost and agency; tracked setup/payoff debts; and a final resolution matching the requested ending. Treat platform/compliance notes as editorial checks, not legal guarantees.
5. Write only the requested episodes using stable scene headings and production-visible action. Include characters present, location/time, action, dialogue, on-screen text, sound, estimated duration, and the final hook. Do not use internal emotion as a substitute for observable behavior.
6. After each accepted script, update the continuity ledger: character knowledge, injuries/wardrobe/props, locations, relationships, promises, reveals, unresolved debts, and episode-end physical state. The next episode must start from that state.
7. Review facts, causality, character voice, duration budget, hook/payoff integrity, duplicated beats, content rating, and exact output scope. Revise only affected episodes and report downstream continuity changes; never silently rewrite accepted fixed facts.

This is a planning and writing Atom. It performs no paid media generation. Use `$character-reference-sheet` for accepted recurring characters, then a film-storyboard Atom when available or `$generate-video` for independently approved atomic shots.
