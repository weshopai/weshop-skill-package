## What this skill does
- Changes palette, tone curve, saturation, grain, bloom, and vignette as one treatment.
- Preserves people, objects, text, crop, and spatial structure.
## How to use
Provide image, filter recipe or reference, intensity, and protected colors.
#### Apply a film look
```text
Apply a restrained 1990s film look with warm highlights, cool shadows, and fine grain at 40%.
```
## Workflow
1. Separate invariants from white balance, contrast, black point, saturation, grain, bloom, and vignette.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. Forbid pose, face, object, background, text, or crop changes.
4. Compare landmarks for drift; inspect skin, neutrals, clipping, banding, noise, and intensity.
5. Retry with narrower controls if content or composition changes.

- Default quantity: 1
- Content per image: Unchanged source content with one grade
