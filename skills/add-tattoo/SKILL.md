## What this skill does

- Produces one image with one tattoo design at one specified body location.
- Conforms ink to skin perspective, curvature, pores, lighting, and occlusion.
- Preserves identity, anatomy, clothing, pose, and scene.

## How to use

Provide one authorized image with visible target skin and describe or supply an original tattoo design.

#### Place a botanical tattoo

```text
Place a small original black botanical linework tattoo along the outer forearm.
```

## Workflow

1. Confirm authorization, visible placement, design ownership, size, orientation, and color.
2. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
3. Edit only the named skin region; preserve anatomy, skin tone and texture, scars and moles outside placement, clothing, pose, crop, lighting, and background.
4. Require natural skin integration without sticker edges, floating ink, duplicated limbs, unrelated body edits, text, or panels.
5. Inspect scale, orientation, curvature, occlusion, skin texture, and identity. Retry only the failed placement or integration property.
