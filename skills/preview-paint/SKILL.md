## What this skill does

- Changes only declared paintable surfaces and respects trim, fixtures, openings and material boundaries.
- Simulates color under source lighting instead of replacing texture or flattening shadows.

## How to use

Provide a room photo, target surface, paint name or color value, finish and protected surfaces.

#### Example

```text
Change only the back wall to muted sage #9AA58D in eggshell; keep trim, ceiling, artwork and lighting unchanged.
```

## Workflow

1. Identify each paintable plane and protected edge; resolve ambiguous walls before editing.
2. Convert color and finish into material-aware instructions under source illumination.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Check edge containment, color family, shadow continuity and unchanged non-target surfaces.

## User-facing output
