## What this skill does

- Freezes the request, approved facts, source assets, constraints, and acceptance checks.
- Produces one structured brief for: traceable chronology from user-supplied evidence.
- Preserves user-approved facts and assets; flags unknowns rather than inventing them.

## How to use

Provide the desired outcome, source material, audience, format, fixed facts/assets, and any must-not-change constraints. This Skill plans and validates; it does not claim an unverified provider execution route.

#### Example

```text
Create a traceable chronology from user-supplied evidence from my approved source material. Preserve the named facts and clearly identify every assumption.
```

## Workflow

1. Confirm user ownership/authorization, fixed facts, target audience, output format, and exclusions.
2. Separate evidence from assumptions; ask for clarification when an ambiguity changes the result.
3. Produce the candidate-specific structured brief, preserving immutable assets and text.
4. Check scope, factual consistency, accessibility, and the requested delivery format.
5. Deliver the brief and acceptance checklist. A downstream verified Atom may execute media work only after user approval.
