## What this skill does
- Maps source identity and reference visual grammar separately.
- Recreates framing, pose energy, lens feel, light, grade, texture, and mood without copying reference identity.
## How to use
Provide one authorized person photo and one visual reference; state protected traits.
#### Recreate a social photo
```text
Use my portrait as the person and image 2 only for composition, light, color, and mood.
```
## Workflow
1. Label identity source and visual reference; never swap roles.
2. Inspect crop, viewpoint, subject scale, gesture, light direction, palette, contrast, grain, and background rhythm.
3. Run `gpt-image` v1.0 with `quality: "medium"`, `imageSize: "2K"`, the supplied references, the requested or source-preserving ratio, `batchCount: 1`, and one result.
4. Preserve identity; reproduce visual grammar rather than the reference face, logos, or text.
5. Reject identity drift, generic studio posing, filter-only output, collage, duplicates, or copied text.
